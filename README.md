🎓  **SchoolManager**
*(Simple School Management System in C++)*
SchoolManager is a console-based C++ application that simulates a simple school management system. It models key roles within a school such as pupils, teachers, and administrative staff using object-oriented programming principles like inheritance and polymorphism.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate practical OOP concepts while simulating real-world operations like grading students, calculating salaries and taxes, and managing school personnel.

🧩 **Key Features**
- Add pupils (boys and girls) with unique IDs and assigned classes.
- Assign grades across various subjects and calculate average scores.
- Display student uniforms in a textual form.
- Manage teachers with optional tutor roles and dynamic salary calculation.
- Handle administrative workers with position levels (junior/senior).
- Simulate gross/net salary and tax deductions using simplified formulas.

🔧 **Technologies Used**
- Language: C++
- Interface: Console-based
- Programming Style: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

📁 Class Structure
- Person → base class for all individuals.
- Pupil → SchoolBoy / SchoolGirl – represents students.
- Worker → Teacher / Admin – represents school employees.
- Teacher → includes support for class tutor assignments.
- Admin → administrative worker with position-based roles.
